Starter Project for Monsters Recycler View

## Why a Recycler View?
### When the user scrolls, visible items which became out of view will be recycled and reused when a new item comes into view.
### We use RecyclerView for a simple reason: your phone have a limited amount of memory. Consequently, if you create for each contact an item, you will use a lot of memory.

## How it Works?
### When the RecyclerView is being laid out and drawn â†’ it will ask the Adapter for the numbers of items that will be displayed.

### Then, the RecyclerView will ask the Adapter to create ViewHolder objects. And the process, inflate individually item views from their corresponding XML by calling onCreateViewHolder.

### After each ViewHolder is created, the RecyclerView will call onBindViewHolder to populate each item with data.

### Then, when you scroll the RecyclerView will reuse those ViewHolders asking the Adapter to bind new data to them.
